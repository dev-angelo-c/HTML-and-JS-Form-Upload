# fileupload
### Bare bones file upload with react
- This uses the Parcel bundler.  
- This software does not modify file names.  
- You will need to add the extension to the file name  
- All it does is get a file to a folder. 

#### To Begin:  
- Open terminal  
- cd to the directory this software is in
- npm install

## Client  
- within ```public/``` directory run ```parcel watch index.html```  

## Server
-```nodemon server.js```

- Option one:  
  Uses an html form element and all of its glory  
  
- Option two:  
  Uses JS and `new FormData()`
