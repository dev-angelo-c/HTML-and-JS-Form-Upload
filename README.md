# fileupload
### Bare bones file upload with react

- This software does not modify file names.  
- You will need to add the extension to the file name  
- All it does is get a file to a folder. 

#### To Begin:  
-Open terminal  
-cd to the directory this software is in  
##Client  
-within ```public/``` directory run ```parcel watch index.html```  
##Server
-```nodemon server.js```

- Option one:  
  Uses an html form element and all of its glory  
  
- Option two:  
  Uses JS and `new FormData()`
